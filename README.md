# Git-Learning-Assignment

In this Git and Github Assignment.
The first Assignment led me through the understanding of version control system and why it is being used and I came across some git command 
tried implementing different git commands. At first I was finding myself in a dilemma about how will I learn the commands but after some 
pracitse, I got good at using the commands and now I am able to work with VCS like Git.

For the second Assignment the question is "A team of 5 developers working on a mobile application project. They will
release 3 revisions of the mobile app. The team uses the google drive to manage the
codebase." and the objective was to "how does this team can get benifit from git.

The 3 benefits the Team will get for using git instead of Google Drive is :
1. They will have a record of changes that will be made by each one.
2. They will able to analyze the code as they can manage the changes made easily.
3. They can use the previous versions as per their need.

For the team to become successfull the 3 features of git that they should learn are:-
1. Git provides compatibility, hence this feature makes git unique in its aspect.
2. Non-linear Development, It allows users from all over the world to access the codebase and perform operations.
3. Branching and maintaining the data of Local Repository.

Mistakes People make during using of git:
1. People tend to forget commiting the work after adding files in the repository.
2. People accidently deletes a branch.
3. Some times people commits changes to the local master repository instead of branch repository.
